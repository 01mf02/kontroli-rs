/// This refers to the variables appearing in a rewrite pattern

/// Historically, this type was created to distinguish variables bound
/// by the rule context and
/// by lambda abstraction, as occurring in higher-order patterns.
/// Because Kontroli abandoned higher-order patterns,
/// this distinction is no longer necessary; however, the name remains as
/// a tribute to Miller's contributions to higher-order rewriting.
